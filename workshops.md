The workshop proposes an interactive session to collaboratively assess how open source, maker and digital projects can grow to have a better social impact.
The collaborative session focuses on key questions such as:
– can makers’ projects scale considering societal and community goods as parameters?
– what is a sustainable way of growing as an innovator?
– can the social impact be the driver of bottom-up innovation?
What will we make?
Participants will be involved in the creation of a DSI Scale, an open source tool that support the maker and open hardware community to grow considering values such as the creation of a community, the technological openness, the communication and the financial sustainability.
