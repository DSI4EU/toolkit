## Instructions

The DSI Scale is an open source tool that facilitates the assessment of DSI projects, taking into account values like knowledge sharing, technological openness and societal impact.  The scale is not predefined: you propose the meaning of each indicator ratings ranging from 0 to 4.

How to build your version of the DSI scale:
– Tell us your name or affiliation (optional)
– Read the information to understand what the indicators should assess
– Select the indicators you would like to define
– Add your meanings to the ratings from 0 to 4 (0=low; 4=high)

Remember: you can define one indicator multiple times; the granularity of the meanings is really important.
