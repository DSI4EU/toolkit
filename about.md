    text: The Digital Social Innovation for Europe (DSI4EU) project aimed to support this growing network of projects providing a bottom-up approach to tech development. To achieve this goal DSI4EU created the digitalsocial.eu platform, which showcases organisations and case studies, helps to identify funding and support opportunities and DSI-related events,
releases all open data and visualizations tools to help understand and analyse the DSI networks. Alongside the digitalsocial.eu platform, the DSI4EU project developed a research on what the DSI landscape in Europe looks like, understanding routes to growth and scale; it developed a set of policy recommendations to support DSI. Finally, by holding a number of events and an experimental programme across Europe to bring together the DSI community, the project aimed at aggregating knowledge and tools to support digital social innovators, especially those involved in the open hardware movement. The Digital Social Innovation toolkit is the result of this last project activity: an experimental programme that, from April 2016 to May 2017 involved makers, researchers, practitioners in workshops, talks and online meetups in which they collaborated with us to understand how open hardware and maker projects scale, taking into account societal and community good as a parameter.
