# DSI TOOLKIT

## How it works

The website in the main folder is generated from the `src` folder, using gulp.

The content, written in markdown, is located in the `src/content/md` folder.

The style, written in stylus, is located in the `src/content/stylus`.

### Gulp is:
1. Compiling css, using stylus and nib
2. Converting the markdown in HTML
3. Assembling the markdown files
4. Uglifying the Javascript.

### To do:
- [ ] @s Analytics (code required)
- [ ] @s,m Fb og tags
