title: Background knowledge
description: This indicator helps you to self-assess your project according to the knowledge that you have of the domain you are addressing with your project action. You can scale if you know who is making something similar or is addressing the same topics of your project; what type of solutions have been already created; who's out there doing the same things, for business or passion or if there is a community already discussing the problem...
indicators:
- I haven't done any research
- I use a product or I built a similar project prototype
- internet resources
- I am interacting with online and offline community of users or stakeholders
- already in contact with the existing organizations or companies
