title: Target and stakeholder mapping 
description: Do you know who your target user is, and who can influence your project? <br> The more you have a clear and complete understanding of the people, groups and communities that can benefit from your project, the easier it will be to scale and increase your impact. Scaling will also be easier if you fully understand all the stakeholders in your project â€“ including those who could support or prevent success.
