title: Quality of the communication 
description: How clear and effective is your communication? <br> The more you communicate your work, goals and impact through evidence, stories and pictures, the easier it will be for you to scale and increase your impact. You can reap more benefits if you talk to international audiences and have online tools which lower the barriers for entry, so that anyone can understand and contribute to your project.
