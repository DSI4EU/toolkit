card-text: Every node of OpenTech School in Europe uses Meet-up as the main platform for sharing information about workshops and events. A curated web platform allows people to access all open source material and teaching resources that are shared on GitHub and translated into many languages. The initiative provides a hands-on learning experience in which people create projects in a welcoming learning environment.

[OpenTechSchool (OTS)](http://www.opentechschool.org/) is a distributed community that opens tech education to everyone. The initiative offers educational courses on technology through hands-on events taking place all across Europe. While the technology community has sometimes been guilty of excluding women and the elderly, OTS is actively inclusive and open to enthusiasts of all genders and ages.

OTS is a community initiative established in Berlin in April 2012. The idea came during a local RailsGirls event, a free tech workshop dedicated to  an audience of women of all ages and backgrounds. The goal of OTS was to expand this concept of openness to all tech topics and to an audience of all genders and experience levels. Given this challenge, hundreds of people joined OTS as coaches, learners, organizers and sponsors in eight cities across Europe: Berlin, Bristol, Brussels, Dortmund, Göttingen, Hamburg and London.

OTS’s mission is to make tech education more accessible and inclusive. Programming is often viewed as something inaccessible, especially by people who have not attended university: this is a misconception OTS wants to break. Their events provide opportunities for adults to try coding by working with their peers in a safe learning environment, where volunteer coaches work with small groups.

The core values of OpenTechSchool reflect the spirit of digital social innovation in the field of education: the training material and [all resources are shared with open licenses](http://learn.opentechschool.org/); the learners are empowered by a progressive learning process that enables them to become coaches themselves; the guidelines to organise workshops with other organisations are also shared, in order to facilitate the creation of a distributed network of similar initiatives. OTS promotes non-profit education; coaches and team members donate their own time for the greater good of the learners and the community. This approach makes the programmes accessible and low-cost.
