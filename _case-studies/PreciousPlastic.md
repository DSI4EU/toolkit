title: Precious Plastic
card-title: Key DSI features 
card-text: The plan and core scope of Precious Plastic is stated clearly in the project’s website, which has been designed to deliver all contents and documents that are necessary to allow other people to replicate the line of plastic recycling machines. The communication of the project is based on the combination of simple design and radical transparency that allows readers (and potential contributors) to understand the plan&#58; to create a network of workshops in which recycling really happens, rather than a platform for selling design objects.

[Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/en/) is an open hardware and design project that offers a new way to recycle plastic. By releasing designs for a family of open source machines, the project promotes and supports the spread of personal and local workshops for the creation of objects out of raw recycled materials.

The Precious Plastic machines allow users to transform plastic bottles into flakes that can be compressed, injected or extruded to create new things. The only limit to what can be made is people’s imagination. All machines are designed to be inclusive and modular, enabling an easy building process; they are open source and all blueprints and instructions are released under the MIT License. Initiated by Dave Hakkens in 2013 as a thesis project at the Design Academy Eindhoven, it took him two years to scale from a research project on materials recycling to the prototype of the machines, and finally to a real functioning ecosystem of machines, blueprints and a community. From the mechanical drawings to the web video tutorials, all of the project’s components are developed collaboratively by volunteers and by the Precious Plastic community which is building and customising machines all over the world. Key to its success is the documenting process carried out through an online platform.

The website also features an updated map that shows all the contributors who are participating in the initiative, with the goal of cleaning the world of plastic waste. Currently, there are machine makers in thirty-six places across six continents; not only in the world’s richest countries (like the US and Western Europe) but also in the Maldives, the West Bank and Sri Lanka, for example. Precious Plastics launched a [MONEY and PEOPLE campaign](https://next.preciousplastic.com/) to spread plastic recycling around the world by:

– creating a series of products that can be made using their machines, with online tutorials to guide people;
– developing their online platform to make collaboration easier;
– providing starter kits to help people build Precious Plastic machines more easily;
– developing business models that will enable people to make a living through the use of plastic waste.
