card-title: Key DSI features 
card-text: Too Wheels is an open source DIY sports wheelchair that can be made in a FabLab. It has been designed to fulfil the needs of multiple targets: from people with disabilities doing sports and organizations developing projects in developing countries, to charities and community organizations who will purchase pre-made wheelchairs, which are easily adjustable on site to fit individual needs. It is a project built upon the idea of distributed peer production for social good, and connected to key stakeholders such as the international FabLab network, the maker community and the organizations promoting sport activities for disabled people.

The device is a solution to the challenges of the cost of fibre installation and other  infrastructure in dense urban areas. It provides an alternative for urban communities who want to create a local and independent internet infrastructure and local internet based services. Koruza has up to 1Gbps capacity - enough to support a large number of moderate internet users - and can be used to build large wireless networks. 

The DIY version of Koruza device features a modular design with 3D-printed components designed in OpenScad, an open-source 3D modeling software. It is available to order as a kit, while the assembly instructions and technical documentation are released online for free. Researchers and indeed anyone with an interest - can replicate the device easily, understand its operation and modify it for their own purposes. 

The Koruza project was developed by [IRNAS, the Institute for Development of Advanced Applied Systems](http://irnas.eu/), in Maribor, Slovenia. The instituteâ€™s mission is to develop open-source and affordable systems that can solve real problems by empowering the masses. Since 2015, its founder Luka Mustafa has been a fellow of the Shuttleworth Foundation, which allowed him to work full-time on the development of Koruza.
