title: Arduino
card-title: Level of openness
card-text: So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice.

The DSI Scale is an open source tool built for and by the community of digital social innovators. It helps to assess the DSI growth considering values as the knowledge sharing, the technological openness, the societal good.

The DSI Scale includes a set of indicators that could help you and policy makers to assess your DSI projects in order to reach a better impact. The scale is not predefined: you propose the meaning of each indicator values ranging from 0 to 4.

How to contribute:
1 - Tell us your name or affiliation (optional)
2 - Chose  more indicator
3 - Read the information to understand what it should assess
4 - Add your definition of the values ranging from 0 to 4 (0=low; 4=high)

### Key DSI Features

Open Drop only uses standard and widely-available components, materials, and production processes. The assembling does not rely on parts that arenâ€™t available to individual customers or processes that require expensive setup costs. The fabrication is also accessible: the design files and software required to operate the hardware are released under open licenses.
